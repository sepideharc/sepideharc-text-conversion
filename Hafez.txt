NOTE


THE last fifteen pieces in this book, which are founded on odes of
Hafez, are not translations. Their aim is rather to convey if possible
something of the original spirit than to give a faithful rendering of
either thought or form; & I have not scrupled to omit, insert, alter or
even deliberately to pervert the idea as fancy or feeling dictated. Some
of the poems follow the Persian fairly closely (especially nos. 30, 31,
34, & 35); others are merely founded on or suggested by one or two
couplets.

No. 4 was suggested by a Persian dialect quatrain by Baba Tahir.

The remainder are original.

*emphasis* When sunlight faileth,  
 & day’s glow is gone;  
 When chill mist traileth  
 Where warm splendour shone;  

 When summer’s pleasure   
 Dieth,—dieth too  
The transient treasure  
That with life up-grew  

& none may herit,  
 Where then wilt thou turn,  
 O vagrant spirit,  
 That no home didst earn;  

When none replieth  
Of thy friends so true,  
 When sweet Joy crieth  
**super**strong ‘Adieu, love, adieu!’

 I called to fading day
 As o’er the hill she flew,
 ‘Whither, glad light, away?
 Take me, O take me too!’
 She said, ‘O wingless one,
 Thou hast thy memoried sun’.

I said to the droop’d rose
 Awhile that was so fair,
‘Why dost so swiftly lose,
Sweet grace, thy blooming air
She said, ‘This is my doom;
 Cherish thou beauty’s tomb’.

I cried to Joy as late
I stood, bidding farewell,
‘Must this be too thy fate
Whom I have loved so well?
He said, ‘My gift I leave
With her whom I bereave’.

youth’s young cloudlet, O freshness free,
With heart so light on the winds to fly
Or glisten in spray up-scatter’d,—I
Am sad as the full surgings of the sea;
I gave thee birth, thou shalt return to me.

>lorem ipsum >>leveltwo

Thy heart is light as the empty wind
Of barren purposeless change,—but I
Am the thought-burden’d slow-searching mind:
I am the agony to form & find;—
The fluxing travail of eternity.
